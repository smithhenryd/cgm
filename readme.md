# Calibrating Generative Models (CGM)

Code for "Calibrating Generative Models" by Henry Smith, Nathaniel Diamant, and Brian L. Trippe

[Preprint]()

We propose two lightweight, general-purpose algorithms, **CGM-relax** and **CGM-reward**, for fine-tuning generative models to match distribution-level constraints. We demonstrate that these algorithms apply to diverse model classes, data, and constraint types. Across all experiments, we find that CGM significantly reduces the constraint violation of the base model, while maintaining the fidelity of samples generated by the model.

## Getting Started
You can try out the `cgm` codebase by opening our demo notebook [`gmm_example.ipynb`](neural_sde/gmm_example.ipynb) in Google Colab. Alternatively, you can clone the `cgm` Github repository and follow our [installation instructions](#installation).

## Installation
### Package manager
We recommend using `conda` or `mamba` to install the `cgm` requirements.
`mamba` can be installed by following [these instructions](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge), which amount to the following:
```
curl -L -O https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh
chmod +x Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh
./Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
### Environment install
The `cgm` environment can be installed from the environment file:
```
mamba create -f env.yml
```
Once you have activated the `cgm` environment, install the `cgm` package (from the root directory of this repository):
```
python -m pip install -e .
```
To use `cgm` in the demo notebook, you also have to install `cgm` as an `ipykernel`:
```
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=cgm
```
You can verify that your installation is correct by running the [tests](#tests), or by running the demo notebook [`gmm_example.ipynb`](neural_sde/gmm_example.ipynb).

## Usage
To perform fine-tuning with CGM-relax or CGM-reward, you will first need to implement a subclass `MyModel` of `Model`, which is contained in `cgm/model.py`. `Model` is an abstract base class that represents the generative model to be calibrated. It has two methods that must be overridden:
    - `sample`: draws samples from the generative model
    - `log_p`: evaluates the log probability of samples from the generative model
An example implementation for continuous-time diffusion models, `NeuralSDE` is given in `neural_sde/neural_sde.py`.

Once you have implemented `MyModel`, you will then need to load or train your base model `base_model` as an instance of `MyModel`. You are then prepared to calibrate `base_model` using CGM-relax
```
from cgm.cgm import calibrate_relaxed

relax_model = calibrate_relaxed(
    base_model
    h,
    hstar,
    lambd,
)
```
or CGM-reward
```
from cgm.cgm import calibrate_reward

reward_model = calibrate_reward(
    base_model
    h,
    hstar,
    N_samps,
)
```

For a full demonstration of the package functionality, see our [example reweighting mixture proportions in a GMM](https://github.com/smithhenryd/cgm/blob/main/neural_sde/gmm_example.ipynb).

## Experiments
### Genie2
To reproduce our code for fine-tuning Genie2, follow these steps:

1. Install `biotite` and `wandb` in your environment
```
mamba install -c conda-forge biotite wandb
```
2. Change your directory to `cgm/genie2/genie2`. Install the Genie2 codebase by running
```
pip install -e .
``` 
3. Download the Genie2 base model checkpoint at [https://github.com/aqlaboratory/genie2/releases/tag/v1.0.0](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/genie2/releases/tag/v1.0.0). We use the checkpoint corresponding to `epoch=40`. Move the checkpoint file into the directory `cgm/genie2/genie2/results/base/checkpoints`.
4. Change your directory to `cgm/genie2/`. Annotate secondary structure for the CATH domains by running 
```
python classify_secstruct_cath.py --jsonl https://people.csail.mit.edu/ingraham/graph-protein-design/data/cath/chain_set.jsonl  \
-o cath_biotite_ss.csv
``` 
which will write the secondary structure of the CATH domains to output file cath_biotite_ss.csv.

You are now prepared to fine-tune the Genie2 base model using CGM. Run, for example,
```
python calibrate_genie2.py \
  --path cath_biotite_ss.csv \
  --calibration_mode relax \
  --const_type bi \
  --N_quantiles 9 \
  --lambda 0.001 \
  --epochs 100 \
  --N_samples 1000
```

## Tests
Make sure the `cgm` environment is activated.
Then run
```
python -m pytest tests
```
